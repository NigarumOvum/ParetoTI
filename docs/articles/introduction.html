<p>This package allows to find tasks that cells need to perform and trade-offs between them.</p>
<p>Need to perform multiple objectives and natural selection put cells on a Pareto front, a narrow subspace of optimal performance. When cells move along this front they trade-off performance at those tasks. Pareto front in the performance space translates into simple shapes gene expression of cell population. By finding minimal simplex polytope (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D, 5-vertex polytope in 4D) that encloses most of the data you can indentify the cellular tasks. This relies on recent work by Uri Alon group that showed that Pareto front is equal to minimal polytope defined by specialist phenotypes (convex hull defined by archetypes) and developed a matlab package ParTI for performing this analysis.</p>
<p>We would strongly reccomend to familiarise yourself with the theory and prevous applications by reading 2015 Nature Methods paper and reviewing lecture materials from Uri Alon’s “Physics of behavour” course at Weizmann Institute:<br>

<p>You need to install development version of this package from github.com and install a python dependency (PCHA algorithm implementation). If you want to take advantage of high-performance computing cluster you need to do extra set up, please follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq">here</a>.</p>

<p>This chapter show how to fit a triange (N-dimensional polytope) to the data. This process reflects finding a Pareto front which is indentical to the convex hull of the data (see the proof of this theorem in Uri Alon 2012 Science paper <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2012/04/25/science.1217405.DC1/Shoval.SM.v2.pdf">Supplement, page 24</a>).</p>

<a href="#evaluating-the-stability-of-vertex-archetypes-positions-using-bootstrapresampling" class="anchor"></a>4. Evaluating the stability of vertex (archetypes) positions using bootstrap/resampling</h2>
<p>Bootstrap or fitting the same shape model to multiple samples of the same data is a useful strategy for understanding how well particular polytope fits the shape of the data and how much certaintly we have in the position of this polytope. A totally different question if how likely you are to obtain the observed shape of the data given no relationship between variables.<br>
Solution to the second problem is shown in the last chapter of this document. This is done by comparing the t-ratio (polytope / convex hull of the data) of observed to randomised data. Complementary to this, variability in positions of vertices in observed data is compared to random data (measured using bootstrap).</p>
<p>In this section, we will first evaluate how well PCHA algorhithm converges to an answer. You can reduce conv_crit parameter to 1e-4 or 1e-3 for reduced computation time by more approximate results. 1e-4 gives very similar results to 1e-5 or 1e-6 on simulated example and STARmap 1020 gene data.<br>
If data has a lot of uncertaintly as of which vertex positions are best match PCHA algorhitm would give variable results.</p>
<p>Note. Algorithm can find the same vertices in a different order so vertexes need to be sorted and arranged according to a common coorditate system. Vertices are ordered by angle (cosine) between c(1, 1) or c(1, 1, …, 1) vector and a vector pointing to that vertex. When comparing datasets the first dimension may change and thus give a different ordering of archetypes when using 2 dimensions. When bootstraping, shapes are aligned by exploring full space of all possible vertex pairings and choosing the pairing that minimises total distance (align_arc() function).</p>

<a href="#pareto-fronts-with-different-number-of-vertices" class="anchor"></a>5. Pareto fronts with different number of vertices</h2>
<p>Although the example used in this tutorial is an obvious triangle it is commonly useful to evaluate which polytope better fit the data. This section shows how to fit polytopes with 1-4 vertices and evaluate variance explained by these models and sum of squared errors.</p>
<p>You can clearly see that 2 vertices, a line, are not enough to describe the shape of this data while 4 vertices are not needed. A more formal way of evaluating this is by looking at variance explained by each of those models (shown in the next subsection).<br>
A complementary approach to find the appropriate the number of vertexes is to evaluate which fit is more stable using fit_pch_bootstrap(). This is due to unstable position of excess points.</p>

<p>This step is necessary for computing the volume of convex hull and t-ratio for a number of reasons: - Triangle does not have a volume in 3D, so qhull algorhirm will fail to find convel hull of flat 2D shapes in 3D, 3D shapes in 4D and so on. The number of vertices should be number of dimensions plus one. - Computation time and memory use increse very quickly with dimensions. So, finding a convex hull is not feasible for all genes in a dataset hence the need for principal component space.</p>
