Description: This package allows you to perform Pareto Task Inference in R as described in
    Yuval Hart & Uri Alon paper in Nature Methods (2015):
    Inferring biological tasks using Pareto analysis of high-dimensional data.
    This package realises polytope dimentionality and
    polytope position fitting using a python 2.7 implementation of PCHA algorithm. 
    PCHA algorithm was originally implemented in Matlab by Morten MÃ¸rup (http://www.mortenmorup.dk/MMhomepageUpdated_files/Page327.htm)
    and re-implemented in python by Ulf Aslak Jensen.    
    Statistical significance of this fit is determined using permutations of the dataset 
    that disrupt relationships between variables but keep the distribution of each variable constant (not implemented yet).
    CAUTION! Package is currently under development! It enables only polytope fitting, bootstrap and visualisations.
    Other analyses, in particular, statistical significance by disrupting relationships between variable, 
    models of feature enrichment at archetype and currently being developed.
    Alternative methods for polytope fitting will be considered such as SPAMS implemented in c++ and using R interface: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yuansi.chen/demo/demo.html, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6472.pdf, http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html
